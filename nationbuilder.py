The  NationBuilder object is used as a way of accessing a NationBuilder Nation.
It contains attributes for accessing the various API endpoints.

Example usage:

# create a NationBuilder object that accesses the slug.nationbuilder.com nation
my_site = nbpy.nationbuilder.NationBuilder("slug", MY_API_KEY)

# get person with ID=123
ppl = my_site.people.get_person(123)

# retrieve the people in list 5
list_five = my_site.lists.get_list(5)
